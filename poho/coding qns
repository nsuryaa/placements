Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n],
 return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
Given a string column title that represents the column title as appears 
in an Excel sheet, return its corresponding column number.
There were two strings given and you have to modify the second string 
according to some rules in comparison to the first string.
The next three questions were from easy to medium. They were:
Check whether a string is a subsequence of another or not.
Letter combination of a phone number. Given a string containing
 digits 0-9, return all possible letter combinations. Letter combination of a phone number.
It was a stack question. It was similar to Decode a string
 recursively encoded as count followed by substring.




1. Find the column number for the given Excel column.

2. Shift the zeros to end. I gave an approach and was asked to optimize without using an extra array, and after some thinking, I solved it.

3. To find the palindrome substring within the given substring I gave one approach, and they were satisfied.

4. A matrix of N*N will be given; we have to find the possible counts of routes if we can move right and down in the matrix towards the end. This was a bit tricky, and I gave some mathematical solutions, but I couldn’t solve it completely, so it was considered an approach.

5. Buy and sell stock to get maximum profit. Straight after reading this question, I knew I wouldn’t be able to solve it with an optimal solution, so I went for the brute force approach and was able to get the output given for the question. I was then asked to optimize, and I tried hard till the time ran out and I couldn’t give them an optimized solution.

There were a total of 6 questions, and I completely answered 4 either with or without an optimal solution, 1 partially, and 1 was unsolved.
