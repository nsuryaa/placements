Min and max nodes of a quad tree.
ChatGPT
A quadtree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children: Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, and Southeast. Each leaf node represents a small, non-overlapping rectangular region of space.

To find the minimum and maximum nodes of a quadtree, we need to define what we mean by "minimum" and "maximum." Let's consider two scenarios:

Minimum and Maximum Depth:

Minimum Node: The leaf node with the smallest depth in the quadtree.
Maximum Node: The leaf node with the largest depth in the quadtree.
Minimum and Maximum Value:

Minimum Node: The leaf node with the smallest value in the quadtree.
Maximum Node: The leaf node with the largest value in the quadtree.
Here's a simple Python implementation using a quadtree structure that considers the minimum and maximum depth:

python
Copy code
class QuadNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.children = [None, None, None, None]  # NW, NE, SW, SE

def min_max_depth(node):
    if node is None:
        return float('inf'), -1

    if all(child is None for child in node.children):
        return 0, 0  # Leaf node

    min_depth = float('inf')
    max_depth = -1

    for child in node.children:
        min_child, max_child = min_max_depth(child)
        min_depth = min(min_depth, min_child)
        max_depth = max(max_depth, max_child)

    return min_depth + 1, max_depth + 1

# Example usage:
# Construct a quadtree
root = QuadNode(1)
root.children[0] = QuadNode(2)  # NW
root.children[1] = QuadNode(3)  # NE
root.children[2] = QuadNode(4)  # SW
root.children[3] = QuadNode(5)  # SE

min_depth, max_depth = min_max_depth(root)

print("Minimum Depth:", min_depth)
print("Maximum Depth:", max_depth)
This example assumes that each leaf node has a depth of 0, and the depth increases as you move towards the root. You can adapt the logic based on your specific requirements for minimum and maximum nodes in a quadtree.
