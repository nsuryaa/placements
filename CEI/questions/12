Given two integers A & B. Determine how many bits required to convert A to B. Write a function
int BitSwapReqd(int A, int B);
ChatGPT
You can determine the number of bits required to convert integer A to integer B by performing the XOR operation on A and B and then counting the number of set bits (bits with value 1) in the result. The count of set bits represents the number of positions where A and B differ. Here's the implementation in C:

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int countSetBits(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    while (n) {
        count += n & 1;
        n >>= 1;
    }
    return count;
}

int BitSwapReqd(int A, int B) {
    int xorResult = A ^ B;
    return countSetBits(xorResult);
}

int main() {
    int A = 14; // Example value for A
    int B = 31; // Example value for B

    int result = BitSwapReqd(A, B);
    printf("Number of bits required to convert A to B: %d\n", result);

    return 0;
}
In this program, the countSetBits function counts the number of set bits in an integer using a simple loop. The BitSwapReqd function calculates the XOR of A and B and then calls countSetBits to determine the number of bits that are different.

Note: This implementation assumes that the input integers A and B are 32-bit integers. If you are working with a different bit size, you may need to adjust the implementation accordingly.
