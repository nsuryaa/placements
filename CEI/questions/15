Write a program to swap two integer pointers.
ChatGPT
Here's a simple C program that demonstrates how to swap two integer pointers:

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

void swapPointers(int** ptr1, int** ptr2) {
    int* temp = *ptr1;
    *ptr1 = *ptr2;
    *ptr2 = temp;
}

int main() {
    int num1 = 5;
    int num2 = 10;

    int* ptr1 = &num1;
    int* ptr2 = &num2;

    printf("Before swapping:\n");
    printf("num1 = %d, num2 = %d\n", *ptr1, *ptr2);

    swapPointers(&ptr1, &ptr2);

    printf("After swapping:\n");
    printf("num1 = %d, num2 = %d\n", *ptr1, *ptr2);

    return 0;
}
In this program:

swapPointers is a function that takes two integer pointers (int**) as arguments and swaps the values they point to.

The main function declares two integers (num1 and num2) and two integer pointers (ptr1 and ptr2) pointing to these integers.

Before swapping, it prints the values of num1 and num2.

It then calls the swapPointers function, passing the addresses of ptr1 and ptr2 to swap their values.

After swapping, it prints the values of num1 and num2 again.

This program demonstrates how to swap two integer pointers, which effectively swaps the integers they point to.
