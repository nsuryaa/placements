To Reverse doubly link list
ChatGPT
To reverse a doubly linked list, you need to swap the next and previous pointers for each node in the list. Here is a simple algorithm to reverse a doubly linked list:

Algorithm to Reverse Doubly Linked List:
1. Initialize three pointers: current, next, and prev.
2. Start from the head of the linked list (the first node).
3. For each node:
   a. Save the next node.
   b. Update the next pointer of the current node to point to the previous node.
   c. Update the previous pointer of the current node to point to the next node.
   d. Move to the next node in the original order.
4. Update the head pointer to the last node (which is the original tail after reversal).
5. The list is now reversed.

Pseudocode:
function reverseDoublyLinkedList(head):
    current = head
    prev = null

    while current is not null:
        next = current.next
        current.next = prev
        current.prev = next
        prev = current
        current = next

    // Update the head to the last node
    head = prev

    return head
