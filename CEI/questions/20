A couple of Boolean logic proofs
ChatGPT
Certainly! Boolean logic proofs often involve demonstrating the equality of Boolean expressions using logical identities and laws. Here are two common proofs:

Proof 1: De Morgan's Laws
De Morgan's First Law:
¬
(
�
∧
�
)
=
¬
�
∨
¬
�
¬(A∧B)=¬A∨¬B

De Morgan's Second Law:
¬
(
�
∨
�
)
=
¬
�
∧
¬
�
¬(A∨B)=¬A∧¬B

Proof: De Morgan's First Law

Left-hand side (LHS): 
¬
(
�
∧
�
)
¬(A∧B)
Apply negation to the conjunction:
¬
(
�
∧
�
)
=
¬
�
∨
¬
�
¬(A∧B)=¬A∨¬B
Right-hand side (RHS): 
¬
�
∨
¬
�
¬A∨¬B
Conclusion: The left-hand side is equal to the right-hand side, and De Morgan's First Law is proven.
Proof: De Morgan's Second Law

Left-hand side (LHS): 
¬
(
�
∨
�
)
¬(A∨B)
Apply negation to the disjunction:
¬
(
�
∨
�
)
=
¬
�
∧
¬
�
¬(A∨B)=¬A∧¬B
Right-hand side (RHS): 
¬
�
∧
¬
�
¬A∧¬B
Conclusion: The left-hand side is equal to the right-hand side, and De Morgan's Second Law is proven.
Proof 2: Idempotent Law
Idempotent Law:
�
∧
�
=
�
A∧A=A
�
∨
�
=
�
A∨A=A

Proof: Idempotent Law for Conjunction

Left-hand side (LHS): 
�
∧
�
A∧A
Apply the idempotent law:
�
∧
�
=
�
A∧A=A
Right-hand side (RHS): 
�
A
Conclusion: The left-hand side is equal to the right-hand side, and the Idempotent Law for Conjunction is proven.
Proof: Idempotent Law for Disjunction

Left-hand side (LHS): 
�
∨
�
A∨A
Apply the idempotent law:
�
∨
�
=
�
A∨A=A
Right-hand side (RHS): 
�
A
Conclusion: The left-hand side is equal to the right-hand side, and the Idempotent Law for Disjunction is proven.
These are just a couple of examples, and there are many more laws and theorems in Boolean algebra that can be proven using similar techniques.
