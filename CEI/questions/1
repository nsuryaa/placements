//Find Error? how and why
ChatGPT
There is an error in the provided code related to the declaration of the array arr in file1.c and its declaration as an external pointer in file2.c. Let's analyze the code:

c
Copy code
// file1.c
int arr[10];
In file1.c, you are correctly declaring an array named arr of type int with a size of 10.

c
Copy code
// file2.c
extern int *arr;
In file2.c, you are declaring arr as an external integer pointer (int *). However, this conflicts with the declaration in file1.c, where arr is an array, not a pointer.

This conflict leads to an error. To fix this, you should declare arr in file2.c as an external array of type int:

c
Copy code
// file2.c
extern int arr[];
This tells the compiler that arr is an array of integers and resolves the conflict. The corrected code would look like this:

c
Copy code
// file1.c
int arr[10];

// file2.c
extern int arr[];

int main() {
    arr[0] = 1;
    return 0;
}
With this correction, you can now use the array arr declared in file1.c in file2.c.
