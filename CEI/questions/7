To print 2's compliment of binary no. given in string. output should also be in string only.
ChatGPT
To calculate the 2's complement of a binary number given as a string, you need to follow these steps:

Invert all the bits (change 0s to 1s and vice versa).
Add 1 to the result obtained from step 1.
Here's a JavaScript function that performs this operation:

javascript
Copy code
function twosComplement(binaryString) {
  // Step 1: Invert all the bits
  let invertedString = '';
  for (let i = 0; i < binaryString.length; i++) {
    invertedString += binaryString[i] === '0' ? '1' : '0';
  }

  // Step 2: Add 1 to the inverted result
  let carry = 1;
  let result = '';
  for (let i = invertedString.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    const sum = parseInt(invertedString[i]) + carry;
    result = (sum % 2) + result;
    carry = Math.floor(sum / 2);
  }

  // If there is a carry after the addition, append it to the result
  if (carry > 0) {
    result = '1' + result;
  }

  return result;
}

// Example usage:
const binaryNumber = '1101';
const twosComplementResult = twosComplement(binaryNumber);
console.log("2's complement:", twosComplementResult);
In this example, the twosComplement function takes a binary number as a string, inverts its bits, adds 1 to the inverted result, and returns the 2's complement as a string.

Make sure to adapt this code to your specific use case if needed.
