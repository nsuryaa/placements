An inorder of binary tree was given and we are asked to draw tree as well as state its postorder
ChatGPT
To reconstruct a binary tree from its inorder traversal and then find its postorder traversal, you can use a recursive approach. The inorder traversal of a binary tree is of the form Left, Root, Right. If you are given the inorder traversal, you can follow these steps:

The last element in the inorder traversal will always be the root.
Divide the remaining elements into two parts - elements to the left of the root represent the left subtree, and elements to the right represent the right subtree.
Recursively repeat steps 1 and 2 for the left and right subtrees.
Let's take an example. Suppose the inorder traversal is [4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 6].

The last element 6 is the root.
Elements to the left [4, 2, 5, 1, 3] represent the left subtree.
Elements to the right are empty because there are no elements to the right of 6.
Now, we repeat the process for the left subtree [4, 2, 5, 1, 3]:

The last element 3 is the root of the left subtree.
Elements to the left [4, 2, 5, 1] represent the left subtree.
Elements to the right are empty because there are no elements to the right of 3.
Continue this process until you have reconstructed the entire tree.

Here is the reconstructed tree for the given inorder traversal [4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 6]:

Now, to find the postorder traversal, you can follow a similar recursive approach:

Recursively find the postorder traversal of the left subtree.
Recursively find the postorder traversal of the right subtree.
Append the root to the result.
For the given example, the postorder traversal would be [4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 6]
