# Computer numbers and there connection ordinates are given prove that all computers are connected to each other

# It seems like there might be a slight misunderstanding in your question. It's not clear what you mean by "computer numbers" and their "connection ordinates." If by "connection ordinates" you mean coordinates or some form of connectivity information, and by "computer numbers" you mean identifiers for different computers, it would depend on the context and the specific information provided.

# If you have a set of computers and their coordinates (or connectivity information), and you want to prove that all computers are connected to each other, you would typically use a graph theory approach.

# Here's a general idea of how you might approach this:

# Define a Graph: Consider each computer as a node in a graph, and the connections between computers as edges. If each computer is connected to every other computer, you have a complete graph.

# Check Connectivity: If the graph is a complete graph, then all computers are connected to each other. You can use graph traversal algorithms (like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) to verify this connectivity.

# Example Pseudocode:

# plaintext
# Copy code
# function areAllComputersConnected(graph):
#     // Use DFS to check connectivity
#     visited = set()
#     startNode = anyNodeInTheGraph  // Choose any node to start the traversal
#     dfs(graph, startNode, visited)

#     // If all nodes are visited, then all computers are connected
#     return length(visited) == number_of_nodes_in_the_graph

# function dfs(graph, node, visited):
#     if node not in visited:
#         visited.add(node)
#         for neighbor in graph[node]:
#             dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
# Apply Connectivity Information: If you have specific coordinates or connectivity information, you need to use that information to construct the graph and then check for connectivity.

# Without more specific details about the data you have, it's challenging to provide a more precise answer. If you can provide more details or an example of the data you're working with, I could offer a more targeted response.
