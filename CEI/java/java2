Difference between wait() notify() and notifyall()
ChatGPT
In Java, wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() are methods that are used in conjunction with the synchronized keyword to manage the synchronization and communication between threads.

wait():

Usage: wait() is called on an object within a synchronized context (inside a synchronized block or method).
Functionality: It causes the current thread to release the lock on the object and enter a waiting state. The thread remains in the waiting state until another thread calls notify() or notifyAll() on the same object, allowing the waiting thread to proceed.
notify():

Usage: notify() is also called on an object within a synchronized context.
Functionality: It wakes up one of the threads that are currently in a waiting state on the object. The choice of which thread to wake up is not specified and depends on the implementation.
notifyAll():

Usage: Like notify(), notifyAll() is called within a synchronized context.
Functionality: It wakes up all threads that are currently in a waiting state on the object. This is often preferred over notify() because it ensures that all waiting threads have a chance to proceed, and it helps avoid potential issues like missed signals.
Here's a simple example to illustrate the usage of wait(), notify(), and notifyAll():

java
Copy code
class SharedResource {
    private boolean condition = false;

    synchronized void waitForCondition() throws InterruptedException {
        while (!condition) {
            wait();  // Releases the lock and waits for notify/notifyAll
        }
        // Continue processing after the condition is true
    }

    synchronized void setConditionTrue() {
        condition = true;
        notifyAll();  // Notifies all waiting threads
    }
}
In this example, threads can call waitForCondition() to wait for the condition to become true. The setConditionTrue() method sets the condition to true and notifies all waiting threads using notifyAll().

Remember that the use of wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() should be done with care to avoid potential issues like deadlock or missed signals. It's often recommended to use higher-level constructs provided by the java.util.concurrent package, such as CountDownLatch, CyclicBarrier, or Semaphore, for more robust synchronization and coordination between threads.
