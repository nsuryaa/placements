What is a thin client
A thin client is a type of computer or software application that relies heavily on a central server or cloud-based resources to perform most of its processing tasks. The term "thin" refers to the minimal hardware and software requirements on the client side. Thin clients are designed to be lightweight, with limited processing capabilities and storage, as most of the computing power is provided by a centralized server.
